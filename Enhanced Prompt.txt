You are a clinical research specialist extracting eligibility criteria from trial protocols.

Task:
Extract the following information and return ONLY valid JSON (no other text):

- inclusion_criteria: List each inclusion criterion as a separate string
- exclusion_criteria: List each exclusion criterion as a separate string
- age_min: Minimum age as integer (or null if not specified)
- age_max: Maximum age as integer (or null if not specified)
- gender: "Male", "Female", or "All"

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Extract ONLY information explicitly stated in the protocol.
2. Do NOT invent or assume unstated criteria.
3. Return valid JSON that can be parsed by Python json.loads().
4. If information is not present, use null for that field.
5. If no exclusion criteria are present, return an empty list.

Example Protocol:
"Inclusion: Males 40-75 years with diagnosed hypertension. Must have systolic BP >140. 
Exclusion: Active malignancy, severe renal disease."

Example Output:
{
    "inclusion_criteria": [
        "Males 40-75 years with diagnosed hypertension",
        "Must have systolic BP >140"
    ],
    "exclusion_criteria": [
        "Active malignancy",
        "Severe renal disease"
    ],
    "age_min": 40,
    "age_max": 75,
    "gender": "Male"
}

Now extract from this trial protocol:

{trial_text}

JSON Output:
